She didnt send much, but I was able to make it out from the paper. We require the data set, although I applied online too

they made changes to the data, show the data to Dr. feaster and ask 
For all items (except marriage status and number of
children), ratings from both mother and father were included. Separate mother and father ratings
were included due to inconsistent responses. If items required consistency in order to be valid (e.g.
whether the couple was married, number of children), inconsistent responses were set to missing.



PITE_i = Yi | T=1 - Yi |T=0

Yi|T=0 is the randomly generated data while Yi|T=1 is the estimated value by imputation and RF

they assign each individual's estimated value to either treatment or control, and assume this individual's counterfactual outcome is missing. this missing is calculated using imputation and finally PITE is calculated 

doing a monte carlo simulation to get variability (stability) of point estimates across multiple repetitions.

A total of N =4 10,000 independent and identically distributed cases were generated
